# ETL-Data-Pipeline
End to End Data Engineering Project  (Python + Panda + SQL SERVER + Power BI)

The diagram illustrates a typical data analysis workflow, from data acquisition to analysis using SQL. Here's a summary of the steps involved:

1.Data Acquisition: The process starts with obtaining the dataset from Kaggle using its API.
  Data Cleaning and Processing: The downloaded data is then cleaned and processed using Python and the Pandas library. This step involves tasks like handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming data into a suitable format for analysis.
2.Load Data: The cleaned and processed data is loaded into a SQL Server database. This step makes the data accessible for SQL-based analysis.
  Data Analysis using SQL: SQL queries are used to extract insights from the data stored in the SQL Server database. These queries can be used to perform various analytical tasks, such as calculating summary 
  statistics, identifying trends, and generating visualizations.
  Overall, the diagram highlights the common steps involved in a data analysis project, showcasing the integration of different tools and technologies for efficient data handling and analysis.
